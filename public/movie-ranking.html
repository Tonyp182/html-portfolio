<h1>The Best Movies According to Anthony</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime. I love the beautiful images and the styling; the music is also cool</p>
<h3>Jack</h3>
<p>Robin Williams is an young boy in an old body. Is this a metaphor for life?</p>
<h3>Drive</h3>
<p>Super beautiful film. Really artistic.</p>
